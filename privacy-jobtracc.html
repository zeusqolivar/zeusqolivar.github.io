    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 23, 2026</p>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>JobTracc</strong> ("the App") handles your information. Your privacy is a priority, and the App is designed to store everything locally on your device. We do not operate servers or collect your data.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> The App does not require a user account. We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p><strong>Job Application Data:</strong> All job applications, interview dates, notes, and reminders you enter are stored exclusively on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data never leaves your device and is never transmitted to any external servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Security Data:</strong> If you enable the app lock feature, your PIN is stored locally on your device. Biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID) is handled entirely by Apple's LocalAuthentication framework on-device. We never have access to your biometric data.</p>
    
    <h2>2. In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The App uses Apple's <strong>StoreKit 2</strong> to process subscriptions. When you make a purchase, Apple collects payment information and transaction history according to their privacy policy. We do not have access to your credit card or billing details. Apple provides us with anonymized transaction identifiers solely to verify your subscription status.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Notifications</h2>
    <p>The App uses local notifications to remind you about upcoming interviews and follow-ups. These notifications are scheduled entirely on your device and do not involve any external push notification servers.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services which may collect data according to their own policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store / StoreKit:</strong> For payment processing and subscription management.</li>
        <li><strong>App Store Connect Analytics:</strong> For anonymized crash reports and app usage statistics to help us improve the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use any third-party analytics SDKs, advertising frameworks, or tracking tools.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Data Export</h2>
    <p>JobTracc Pro subscribers can export their job application data to a CSV file. This file is generated locally on your device and shared only through the system share sheet at your discretion. We never receive a copy of your exported data.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since no personal data is collected from any user, we are compliant with COPPA regulations.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately upon being posted.</p>

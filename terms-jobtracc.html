    <h1>Terms of Use (EULA)</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 23, 2026</p>
    
    <p>By downloading or using <strong>JobTracc</strong> ("the App"), these terms will automatically apply to you. Please read them carefully before using the App.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Standard Apple EULA</h2>
    <p>The App is licensed to you, not sold. Your use of the App is subject to your prior acceptance of Apple's <strong>Standard Licensed Application End User License Agreement</strong> ("Standard EULA"), which can be found at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank">Apple's website</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <p>The App offers an optional auto-renewable subscription ("JobTracc Pro"). Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at the confirmation of purchase. The subscription automatically renews unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</p>
    <p>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.</p>
    <p>The free tier allows up to 10 job applications. Subscribing to JobTracc Pro removes this limit and unlocks additional features including CSV export and custom follow-up reminders.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Data & Storage</h2>
    <p>All data you enter into the App is stored locally on your device. You are solely responsible for maintaining backups of your device. We are not liable for any data loss resulting from device failure, software updates, or deletion of the App.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the App only for its intended purpose of tracking job applications and related career information. You agree not to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the App.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. We make no warranties, expressed or implied, regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of any features, notifications, or reminders provided by the App. Interview reminders and follow-up notifications are provided as a convenience and should not be solely relied upon for time-critical events.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall the developer be liable for any loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages of any kind arising from your use of the App, including but not limited to missed interviews, lost job opportunities, or data loss.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes will mean that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>

    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 2026</p>
    
    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading or using "You're Almost There" (the "App"), these terms will automatically apply to you. You should make sure that you read them carefully before using the App.</p>

    <h2>2. App Usage and Limitations</h2>
    <p>The App is designed as a utility to help alert you when you are near a specific geographic location. However:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Guarantee:</strong> We cannot guarantee that the alarm will trigger with 100% accuracy due to potential limitations in device hardware, GPS signal availability, battery saving modes, or operating system constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You are ultimately responsible for arriving at your destination. The App should not be relied upon as the sole method to prevent missing your stop, especially for critical journeys.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Location Data</h2>
    <p>The App requires "Always" or "While in Use" location permissions to function. By using the App, you consent to the processing of your location data as outlined in our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Modifications to the App</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to make changes to the App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the App or its services without making it very clear exactly what you're paying for.</p>

    <h2>5. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the App immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason, including if you breach the Terms.</p>
